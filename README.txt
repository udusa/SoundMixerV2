Sound:
1. keyboard: V & X
2. Experiment config file: Noise (loop), List of word file (By order, Shaffle – random seed).
2.1 Starting point (SNR),
2.2 Single false: +SNR, single / double true - SNR
2.3 dSNR according to the SNR range: [10,15] +-3, [5,10] +-2, [5,0] +-1, [0,-5] +-0.5
3. output: csv file – each word is a line.
4. compute the min SNR for which the experiment has 50% true rate
5. UI for SNR in time.
